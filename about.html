            Hi! My name is Ciara Robinson and I am 20 years old. My dream is to be able to provide entertainment for people around the world. I love creating content for my youtube channel and streaming on twitch. A little bit about me. I used to live in a small town called Manitouwadge in Ontario Canada before I moved to Ottawa to go to school. This big move was very hard for me. I packed my bags and moved 15 hours away from my family and basically everything that I have ever known. I had a lot of adjusting to do. The one thing that got me through the tough move was creating content! I mainly stream on twitch because that’s all I have time for because I am going to school full time. A few of my hobbies are streaming, playing video games, reading, and driving.

            I stream on twitch however because of school my streaming schedule is a bit weird. I have classes at odd times of the day but for only 3 days of the week. So for the other 4 days if I don’t have homework I will be streaming almost all day. I try to stream at around 8 or 9 pm and I try to stream for about 5 to 7 hours. Eventually when I get my youtube started I will be posting Mondays, Wednesday’s, and Friday’s with maybe a bonus video on Saturday’s. And I post on tik tok 3 times a day.
