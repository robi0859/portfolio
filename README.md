# portfolio
This is my portfolio

Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

- My process for creating my portfolio was simple. I would design the portfolio and then go back into the assignment and add all the recirements. some of the challenges I faced was not having th motiviation to build the website anymore as well as not being able to get the css library to work. Well creating my web portfolio I have learned that I don't really like web development and that I am not very good at it, however I will try my best to improve on my skill for the future.
