            Hey Gamers, my name is Synrro and welcome to my channel. I am a gamer who plays games like Valorant, Fortnite, Phasmophobia, and Minecraft. What you can expect to see on the channel are clips from my twitch streams (which btw, I will be streaming regularly so you should follow). The goal of the channel is to make you (the viewer) laugh and have a good time while doing something I love. If you want more from me go check out my socials, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. Thatâ€™s it for me, I hope you have a good rest of your day or night wherever you are! GG!
